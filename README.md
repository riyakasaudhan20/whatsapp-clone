## About

This project showcases my effort in building a real-time chat application similar to WhatsApp. By combining Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend, I've crafted an application that allows users to exchange messages in real-time, creating a seamless and interactive communication experience.

## Getting Started

To explore the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the backend directory to set up the Spring Boot application.
3. Configure the database settings in `application.properties`.
4. Implement user authentication to ensure secure access to the chat application.

## Authentication

For security, I've implemented a robust user authentication system using Spring Security. This ensures that only registered and authorized users can access the chat application and exchange messages.

## Backend Development

The backend development involved building a scalable and efficient backend using Spring Boot. I handled incoming WebSocket connections, managed user sessions, and set up a RESTful API for seamless frontend communication.

## Frontend Development

The frontend development focused on creating an intuitive user interface using React. I designed UI components, displayed user messages, and managed the chat interface to provide an engaging and responsive experience.

## Real-Time Messaging

I implemented real-time messaging using SockJS and STOMP.js. This enables users to send and receive messages instantly, mirroring the instant messaging capability of platforms like WhatsApp.

## Additional Features

To enhance the chat experience, I added features such as typing indicators, read receipts, and message notifications. These additions make the application more dynamic and user-friendly.

## Deployment

The deployment process involved hosting the chat application on a cloud platform. This ensures global accessibility and allows users from various locations to utilize the application.

## Usage

Refer to the documentation or instructions provided to understand how to use the deployed chat application. Users can sign up, log in, send messages, and explore the application's features seamlessly.

## Built Using

I utilized the following technologies and tools to develop the WhatsApp Clone:

- Spring Boot
- React
- SockJS
- STOMP.js
- MySQL (or your chosen database)

## TODO

In the future, I plan to implement further improvements, features, or optimizations to enhance the chat application's functionality.
